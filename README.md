This is the source code of the original CROBOTS game that I wrote in 1985, now
released under GPLv2.   

I probably will **not** be updating CROBOTS, so feel free to fork the code.

Original Readme
---------------

CROBOTS ("see-robots") is a game based on computer programming.
Unlike arcade type games which require human inputs controlling
some object, all strategy in CROBOTS must be complete before the
actual game begins.  Game strategy is condensed into a C language
program that you design and write.  Your program controls a robot
whose mission is to seek out, track, and destroy other robots,
each running different programs.  Each robot is equally equipped,
and up to four robots may compete at once.  CROBOTS is best
played among several people, each refining their own robot
program, then matching program against program.

CROBOTS consists of a C compiler, a virtual computer, and
battlefield display (text graphics only, monochrome or color).
The CROBOTS compiler accepts a limited (but useful) subset of
the C language.  The C robot programs are aided by hardware
functions to scan for opponents, start and stop drive mechanisms,
fire cannons, etc.  After the programs are compiled and loaded
into separate robots, the battle is observed.  Robots moving,
missiles flying and exploding, and certain status information are
displayed on the screen, in real-time.
